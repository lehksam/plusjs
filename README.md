PlusJS is an ultra lightweight, virtual-DOM free frontend framework.
# Features
## Fine-grained reactivity
Changes to items in an array update only the elements that are directly associated with those items.
This allows for a near vanilla performance.

## No extra syntax
Use HTML strings to build your components. Inject states directly into your strings. Built-in directives allows to build visual elements from list states and use functions as event handlers.

## Supports async states
States automatically update when their promises resolve.
